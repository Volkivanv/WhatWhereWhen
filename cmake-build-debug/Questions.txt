<1. I am purple, yellow, red, and green
The King cannot reach me and neither can the Queen.
I show my colors after the rain
And only when the sun comes out again.>

<2. It is blue and green, and red,
It bounces higher than my head,
It does not want to stop at all.
What is it? It is my...>

<3. Clean, but not water,
White, but not snow,
Sweet, but not ice-cream,
What is it?>

<4. I am always hungry,
I must always be fed,
The finger I touch,
Will soon turn red.>

<5. I am round like an apple
Flat as a chip
I have eyes
But I can't see one bit.>

<6. What has a head like a cat,
Feet like a cat,
A tail like a cat,
But isn't a cat?>

<7. Always runs but never walks,
Often murmurs, never talks,
Has a bed but never sleeps,
Has a mouth but never eats?>

<8. I fly, yet I have no wings.
I cry, yet I have no eyes.
Darkness follows me;
Lower light I never see.>

<9. What gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?>

<10. I am lighter than a feather, yet the strongest man can't hold me for more than 5 minutes.>

<11. What needs an answer but doesn't ask a question?>

<12. What comes down but never goes up?>

<13. The more you have of it, the less you see.>
